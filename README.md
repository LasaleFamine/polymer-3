# Polymer 3, Webpack and PostCSS (and not everything within a file)
> This is an example on how to organize a project (or an element) to develop with Webpack and PostCSS, on top of Polymer 3 and Web Components.

#### NOTE on Polymer 3 no-flat
I'm using a modified version of Polymer 3 removing the `flat` property from the package.json. I have problems with dependencies `import`s while using `webpack` due to that evil property.

## Webpack configuration

## How PostCSS files are loaded
